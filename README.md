# HW-Wireframe
Easier Assingment - Building a Wireframe

Instructions

Create a new repository in GitHub called HW-Wireframe.
Clone this repository to your computer by following the process we went over in class.
Navigate to the HW-Wireframe folder you just cloned onto your machine. Then create two files inside this folder: index.html and style.css.
Make your initial Git commit and push it to GitHub.

git add .
git commit -m "<COMMENT>"
git push origin master
If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in your repository. This will be your initial test to confirm that you're hooked into GitHub.

Return to your local copies of index.html and style.css. Using the screenshot at the top of these instructions, recreate the design using HTML/CSS.

All of your HTML should be inside of the index.html file.
All of your CSS should be inside of the style.css file.

When you finish the assignment, commit your changes with Git and push them into your GitHub repo. Remember:
git add .
git commit -m "<COMMENT>"
git push origin master

Student Notes

This exercise will challenge most students unfamiliar with HTML/CSS. If you see this task as too simple or if you finish it within three hours, attempt the second homework assignment.

Just because this is the "easier" assignment does not make it the "quick" one. The process of learning web development is nothing without a serious time investment. While the work may seem strenuous now, you'll find yourself becoming more comfortable with web development as you put more hours into your training.

Commits
Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
